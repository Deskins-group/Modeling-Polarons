**Introduction**

This section provides many details on modeling polarons using electronic structure theory, especially with density functional theory (DFT). I assume you know how to run DFT calculations, but want to know more about modeling polarons. We discuss the challenges in modeling polarons and how to overcome these challenges. You’ll find advice, ideas, and some references that may help get you started.

**Background**

There are two broad classes of charge carriers in semiconductors: polarons and bands. Polarons occur as electrons or holes in semiconductors distort the lattice and become localized within the lattice. This slows down the mobility of charge carriers relative to bands, and leads to a distortion around the polaron site. Both large and small polarons occur, depending on the extent of the distortion, and each has unique properties. Furthermore, polarons may be negatively charged (electrons) or positively charged (holes). Several reviews exist on the study of polarons.

Polarons may occur in materials as excess electrons or holes form. Photoexcitation may create polarons, where excited electrons and holes are created. Defects in a material may also create polarons, either excess electrons or a deficit of electrons (hole). For example, formation of an oxygen vacancy in a metal oxide such as TiO2 creates excess electrons that may localize as polarons. A dopant, like Nb in TiO2, may also create an excess electron that forms a polaron.

The nature and properties of polarons (such as size, mobility, and stability) are all important, as they strongly influence the applicability of a material for a given application. For example, polarons may limit or determine the conductivity within a semiconductor used in electronic devices. Polarons may also enable reduction or oxidation reactions, such as in photocatalysis. Polarons may also play an important role in geochemical processes that occur with minerals. Thus, the study of characterization of polarons is an on-going area of research.

Polarons can be modeled using electronic structure methods, such as density functional theory. Challenges, however, do exist in modeling polarons, as discussed here. An example polaron in TiO2 is shown below. Note that the electron polaron exists as a d orbital localized on a Ti atom. Further examples abound in the literature, and polarons have been observed in many materials, such as HfO2, FeO, FePO4, BaTiO3, BiVO4, and others. A literature search (such as “polarons density functional theory”) will give many examples of modeling polarons.

**Challenges**

Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most popular electronic structure methods due to its good balance between accuracy and speed. Other theoretical methods exist (see Franchini, C., Reticcioli, M., Setvin, M., & Diebold, U. (2021). Polarons in materials. Nature Reviews Materials, 0123456789.), but DFT is the most common method for atomistic material simulations, due to its balance of accuracy and computational time. A central problem in modeling polarons with DFT is the delocalization of electrons that may occur due to self-interaction errors. Self-interaction errors (see Pacchioni, Gianfranco. “Modeling doped and defective oxides in catalysis with density functional theory methods: Room for improvements.” The Journal of chemical physics 128.18 (2008): 182505 ; Ganduglia-Pirovano, M. Veronica, Alexander Hofmann, and Joachim Sauer. “Oxygen vacancies in transition metal and rare earth oxides: Current state of understanding and remaining challenges.” Surface science reports 62.6 (2007): 219-270. ; Huang, Patrick, and Emily A. Carter. “Advances in correlated electronic structure methods for solids, surfaces, and nanostructures.” Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 59 (2008): 261-290) occur with many common exchange-correlation potentials, leading to the wrong description of polarons in many materials.

See for example below two different DFT solutions for TiO2. One solution (with self-interaction errors) leads to an unpaired electron being delocalized throughout the simulation cell. The proper solution has the electron localized on a Ti atom, forming a polaron state. If one is to model polarons, then the ‘correct’ method must be chosen in order to avoid an incorrect description of polarons.

While DFT often fails to properly model polarons, methods do exist which enable localization of polarons. The DFT+U method (Dudarev, S. L., Botton, G. A., Savrasov, S. Y., Humphreys, C. J., & Sutton, A. P. (1998). Electron-energy-loss spectra and the structural stability of nickel oxide: An LSDA+U study. Physical Review B, 57(3), 1505–1509. ; Tolba, S. A., Gameel, K. M., Ali, B. A., Almossalami, H. A., & Allam, N. K. (2018). The DFT+U: Approaches, Accuracy, and Applications. Density Functional Calculations – Recent Progresses of Theory and Application, 3–30. ; Capdevila-Cortada, M., Łodziana, Z., & López, N. (2016). Performance of DFT+ U Approaches in the Study of Catalytic Materials. ACS Catalysis, 6(12), 8370–8379. ; Himmetoglu, B., Floris, A., de Gironcoli, S., & Cococcioni, M. (2014). Hubbard-corrected DFT energy functionals: The LDA+U description of correlated systems. International Journal of Quantum Chemistry, 114(1), 14–49.) is one of the common approaches to enabling charge localization. DFT+U adds a correction term (hence +U) to DFT calculations to help remove self-interaction errors. It requires little more computational time than standard DFT calculations, and is therefore one of the most popular methods for modeling polarons. A different approach uses hybrid functionals (Deák, P., Aradi, B., & Frauenheim, T. (2011). Polaronic effects in TiO2 calculated by the HSE06 hybrid functional: Dopant passivation by carrier self-trapping. Physical Review B, 83(15), 155207. ; Finazzi, E., Di Valentin, C., Pacchioni, G., & Selloni, A. (2008). Excess electron states in reduced bulk anatase TiO2: Comparison of standard GGA, GGA+U, and hybrid DFT calculations. The Journal of Chemical Physics, 129(15), 154113. ; De Lile, J. R., Kang, S. G., Son, Y.-A., & Lee, S. G. (2019). Investigating Polaron Formation in Anatase and Brookite TiO2 by Density Functional Theory with Hybrid-Functional and DFT + U Methods. ACS Omega, 4(5), 8056–8064.). Such functionals also enable localization of polarons, but often require considerable more computational time. In any case, an appropriate method must be chosen so that ‘correct’ localization of polarons occurs.

Even if a method is applied that overcomes self-interaction errors, polaron formation is not guaranteed. For a given level of theory there may be several stable or metastable solutions (Meredig, B., Thompson, A., Hansen, H. A., Wolverton, C., & van de Walle, A. (2010). Method for locating low-energy solutions within DFT+U. Physical Review B, 82(19), 195128). The initial structure and wavefunction may all influence whether polarons form. Key characteristics of a polaron are the distortion of bonds between the polaron site and neighboring atoms, as well as the occupancy (or vacancy for holes) of electronic orbitals. The polaron essentially breaks the symmetry of the crystal as the distortions and electrons are centered around the polaron site. Simply using default settings or perfect crystals may not enable polaron formation. The simulation input must be chosen so that initial geometries and/or electronic orbitals mimic a polaron to enable convergence to a stable polaron solution.
